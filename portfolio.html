        <h2>Something interesting</h2>
        <p>We all are working so hard to acheive something or other. In aim of that I have done internship in Velankani, so here I am going to share
            my experience.</p>
        <p>Working in a new city is not that easy with different culture, people, why not weather if we are talking about Bangalore and what not. First day,
            city was little harsh on me, didn't got bus got late on first day tried to make friends but failed and then sat on wrong bus while returning back
            after all this I still gathered my hopes and went to home and calmed myself to fight and work against all the odds but finally after a few days 
            I managed to make collegues my friends and tried to fit between the office culture and language barrier communication.

            Travelling 20km a day was not easy but it was fun catching bus on time, most happy to find a seat or talking to someone without any particular reason.
